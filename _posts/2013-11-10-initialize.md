Yet another attempt at a blog. Since 2006 I've blogged on matt-beedle.com and
then mattbeedle.com. Once with over 1000 UVs per day. Unfortunately I never seem
to manage to keep it up. Both domains were eventually forgotten about and
expired, all the posts only remaining now in the web archive. At least this time
everything is stored in Git on GitHub! Let's see how long it lasts for.

I'm planning to blog about code and startup experience. Stay tuned.
