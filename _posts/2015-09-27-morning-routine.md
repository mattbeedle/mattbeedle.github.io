I've been struggling a bit with productivity at recently, working for a startup, from home, with
a 1 year old child. 9am I wake up, 2 hours later than I would like, then
after a shower and 30 minutes work it's time for family breakfast. Then my
girlfriend is in the shower and I need to keep an eye on my son. Another hour of
work, then it's lunch time. Another couple of hours after that it's dinner,
getting my kid to bed, etc. Now it's late, I spend several tired, less
productive hours trying to cram a day of work in. I go to bed late and tired.
Rinse and repeat. This routine has been really affecting my productivity,
health, fitness, etc.

I've read a lot
about how important good habits and a morning routine are for success. A good
morning routine sets you up to win at your day and at life in general.
Since this week I've implemented a new routine and it's amazing. I'm now up
every morning at **5:30am** and started [intermittent
fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting) again.

## My Routine

### 1. Wake up at 5:30am and drink a large glass of water

When you wake up, whether you feel it or not, your body is dehydrated. Drinking
a large glass of water not only rehydrates you, but apparently also has numerous
thereputic effects. I leave a glass full next to my bed before I sleep so I can
have it at room temperature instead of having to drinking freezing water
straight from the cooler.

### 2. Have a freezing cold shower (5 minutes)

[Benefits of a cold
shower](http://impossiblehq.com/cold-shower-health-benefits/)
include better immune system, fat loss, improved
circulation, temperature regulation, relief from symtoms of depression, health
skin/hair, testosterone increase, fertility increase, energy increase, lymphatic
movement, inflammation decrease, better breathing, better sleep, tolerance to
stress. Wow, they are healthy. Also hard to start doing. I'm pretty sure the
neighbours could hear me screaming on the first day. I've already got much more
used to them now though after only a few days.

### 3. Brush teeth / get dressed (2 minutes)

Even working at home, it's important to have the feeling of "going to work".
I wear pretty much the same clothes every day, so there's no decision making
there in the morning.

### 4. Meditate (15 minutes)

I use [headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) for this, although I'm thinking of investing in a [Muse headband](http://www.choosemuse.com/).

### 5. Brew a bullet-proof coffee (10 minutes)

[This
stuff](https://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/)
is really great. It gives me a huge morning energy/concentration boost. That
being said I do seem to get less of a boost now than I used to. Maybe it's one
of those slippery slope things and I'll end up doing morning lines of speed by
next year. I brew
my coffee using a stove top espresso maker. While that's going on I do the
washing up if there is any.

### 6. Read something (20 minutes)

I like to read something technical in the morning when my mind is most
receptive. At present I'm reading [JavaScript
Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge).

### 7. Write something (20 minutes)

I always used to be annoyed at myself for not writing any blog posts. Now, with
20 minutes per morning I should be able to pump out at least 1 per week.
Hopefully I'll get a bit faster at this with practice. Maybe now I'll also find
time again to continue writing the EmberJS/Rails book I started over a year
ago.

### 8. Daily goals (5 minutes)

I review all of my tasks in [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/).
This used to take a long time but now I do it daily it's really fast. I pick
3 things that need to get done for that day and flag them. I also do have
a bunch of recurring flagged tasks in here.

### Start working

In under an 1.5 hours I've already got a load of things done that I never
normally have time for and I have a blissful 5 hours to work with no
interuptions until workout/lunch time. During this working stretch I switch on "Do Not Disturb" in Notification Center,
turn off [AirMail](http://airmailapp.com/)/[TweetBot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)/etc,
and I work in [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
using [Vitamin-R](http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/)
At the moment I'm working for a startup
([Groove](https://www.groovehq.com) where the development tasks are nicely
planned out already in PivotalTracker and Github. If I were doing some other job
I would probably need to add a day planning phase where
I actually prioritise and plan out the tasks that I need to run through that day.

In conclusion I'm so far very happy with this experiment and can definitely see
myself sticking to it. You should definitely give it a go too.
